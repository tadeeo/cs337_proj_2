  "wild rice": "Wild rice is an annual aquatic grass, which produces an edible seed. It grows in the shallows of lakes and rivers throughout eastern and north central North America.  Native North Americans have harvested and eaten wild rice for centuries.  Since they first presented wild rice to the early North American explorers and fur traders, this unusual cereal grain (the only one native to North America) has been prized for its distinctive natural flavor and texture.  Natural stands of wild rice grow in the clear lakes of northern Manitoba.  Preserved wild rice grains have been found at North American archeological sites.  These findings seem to indicate that wild rice has been an important North American native food for at least 1,000 years.",
  "wonton, won ton": "(WAHN-tahn) – Wonton literally means, “swallowing a cloud” in Chinese.  They are a very popular Chinese delicacy.  They are small shapes of very thinly rolled dough, filled with sweet or savory mixtures.  The size and shape of wontons, and the type of filling used, vary according to the different culinary traditions in each region of China.  They may be boiled, steamed, or deep-fried and served as an appetizer, snack, or side dish (usually with several sauces).",
  "Worcestershire sauce": "(WOOS-tuhr-shuhr) – A condiment that was developed in India by the British.  This thin, dark, spicy sauce got its name from the city where it was first bottled, Worcester, England.  It is used to season meats, gravies, and soups.  The formula usually includes soy sauce, onions, molasses, lime, anchovies, vinegar, garlic, tamarind, as well as other spices.  The exact proportions of the ingredients remain the manufacturer’s secret.",
  "XXX,XXXX,10X": "An indicator on a box of confectioners’ sugar of how many times it has been ground.  The higher the number of X’s the finer the grind.",
  "yeast": "(yeest) – Yeast is alive!  It is a microscopic, single-cell organism that, as it grows and ferments, produces alcohol and carbon dioxide.  The carbon dioxide bubbles get trapped in the gluten strands of bread, causing it to rise.  The most commonly available form is active dry yeast; the tiny organisms are dehydrated, and therefore dormant due to the lack of moisture.  Yeast should be “proofed” (or “activated”) in water heated to approximately 110 degrees F.",
  "yogurt, yoghurt": "(YOH-gert) – The word is Turkish.  It is a dairy product made from milk curdled with bacteria.  Recipes that most often call for yogurt are East Indian, Balkan, Russian, and Middle Eastern in origin.  Cooks in those areas use yogurt in marinades and sauces.  Because of its acidity, yogurt can be used to marinate and tenderize meats (as it often is used in India and the Middle East).  Yogurt can also be used to bind ingredients loosely together, as in a sauce or salad dressing.  Yogurts made in the U.S. are made of cow’s milk.  Those of India and the Middle East are more likely to be of the richer goat, sheep, or yak milk.",
  "Yorkshire Pudding": "(YORK-sheer) – First cousin to the popover, this is a traditional English accompaniment to roast beef.  The batter for Yorkshire Pudding is exactly the same as a popover batter, but it is baked in roast beef drippings and becomes a main course “pudding.”  It may be cooked in one large dish or in muffin tins as small individual puddings.  It takes its name from England’s northern county of Yorkshire.",
  "zabaglione": "(zah-bahl-YOH-nay) – In Italian it means “egg punch.”  It is a light, fluffy Italian dessert made from whisked egg yolks, sugar, a touch of salt, and wine (traditionally Marsala).  The mixture is beaten over simmering water so that the egg yolks cook as they thicken.  Traditional zabaglione must be made just before serving.  There is also a frozen version.  In France it is called sabayon.",
  "zest": "Grated zest is simply the grated rind (outer colored portion) from citrus fruits.  It is used in cooking because the rind holds the precious oils where the entire flavor resides.  To grate zest or rind, take a box grater and rub the fruit against the grater.  Do not rub the fruit down to the white inner skin, known as the pith, because the pith is bitter.  When removing the skin from oranges or other citrus fruit, be sure to take only the thin outer zest or colored portion.  The white pith will give your dish a bitter under-taste.",
  "Zinfandel wine": "(ZIHN-fuhn-dehl) – A red wine grape that seemed to be indigenous to California for many years.  It is now thought to have originated in Italy.  The best Zinfandels are from Northern California and were grown for decades by Italian immigrants.",
  "zwieback": "(ZWI-bak) – The word is German for “twice baked.”  They are dry toasted bread slices, long popular for their digestibility and often served to young children."
